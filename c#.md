# Data Structure
  * Array -> Can't Grow in size
  * ArrayList -> Can grow in size but casting is required to retrive the value (ArrayList a= new ArrayList ; a.Add(0) //Add(object? value)
  * List -> Can grow in size (TypeSafe)
  * Hashtable -> Key - Value pair. Both values are Objects. So casting is required to retreive.
  * Dictionary -> Strongly typed key value pair
  * SortedList -> Sorted generic Generic, Bit slower while inserting.
